Mist
====

Abstract
--------

An peer-to-peer Internet of Things application development framework would enable large 
scale projects without costly investments in infrastructure. Repeatedly 
re-inventing the complicated parts of distributed systems have made them less
attractive to developers, and too big a step for companies developing new
applications. 

Mist is designed with security and scalability in mind. Connectivity, security 
and access control are part of the specification.

Introduction
------------

Mist is a library for building peer-to-peer Internet of Things applications. It 
is based on the Wish protocol, and uses the Wish Core implementation.

Wish Core is a distributed trust-based networking tool for building applications. It 
provides basic functionality to build secure social network structured 
applications without having to re-invent the wheel every time.
